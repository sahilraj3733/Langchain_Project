# 🧠 LangChain Project Collection

Welcome to the **Langchain_project** repository! This is a curated collection of projects and experiments built using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) — a powerful framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains multiple LangChain-based projects that demonstrate how LLMs can be integrated into real-world applications, including:

- 🤖 Chatbots & Assistants  
- 📄 Document Question Answering (PDF, Text)
- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🛠️ Tool-using Agents (e.g., using APIs, calculators)
- 📚 Vector Store Integrations (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
- 📦 End-to-End LLM Pipelines with Memory, Chains & Agents
